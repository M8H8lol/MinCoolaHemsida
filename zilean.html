        <h2>Zilean</h2>
        <p>
          Zilean is another one of the strong but unique champions. His kit
          mostly contains of keeping his teamamtes alive while providing buffs
          for his teammes and crowd-controlling the enemies. If his kit is used
          effectivly, he can be very frustrating to play with considering how he
          can keep any teammate alive with his ultimate which makes him have
          huge impact throughout the whole game.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            Zilean early game can be pretty frustrating considering he doens't have alot of abilities that help him in early game. His bombs is good poke put most poke supports can provide better poke while also staying further away. His strong sides is around mid/lategame where he has gotten his first item (which is usually Twin shadows if you run Glacial Augment) and after he gets around level 13 (because he gets his E and his Q maxed which gives him a great amount of cc). 
        </p>
        <h3>Strenghts</h3>
        <p>
            His ult is one of his strenghts because he litteraly has a 40 seconds guardians angel that he can give to anyone. His combo with slowing and then double bombing them makes him really frustrating to play against in most cases. 
        </p>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
            In early game, he gets outperformed in every aspect by most supports. If you play him midlane then you're most likely gonna get outperformed by every single midlaner. 
        </p>
        <h3>Good pick with these teammates</h3>
        <p>
            Jhin: Mostly plays around his movement speed, which Zilean can increase by alot. 
            <br>Hecarim: Gets more damage the more movement speed he has
            <br>Udyr: Fast boy
        </p>
        <h3>Counterpicks</h3>
        <p>
            Most early game dominant laners such as Pyke, Morgana and most characters that have a dash.
