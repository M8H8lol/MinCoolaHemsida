        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Thresh gameplay varies depending on what you're going for. Either he
          can be really aggresive, hit his hooks and chain cc whoever he desires
          and keep them in place as long as he wants. He is also very effective
          at keeping his teammates safe considering his W: "D"ark Passage" That
          lets him pull his teammates to his side so they can get out of trouble
          that they put themselves in.
        </p>
        <h3>Strenghts</h3>
        <p>
          He has great cc abilities such as his hook, his flay and his ultimate.
          With only those 3 he can keep enemies in place as long as he hits his
          fairly hard to hit abilities. He also has a great peeling ability,
          that I brought up in the gameplay paragraph where he can pull
          teammates to him which requires him to position himself very well for
          him and his teammate to get out safe.
        </p>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          One of his biggest weaknesses is being bad, if you dont hit your hook
          then you wont hit any other cc ablity (most likely) which makes him
          lose one of his biggest strenghts, his cc (crowd control). He can also
          get outpoked very easiely considering he cant really sustain himself
          too easiely. So if put against a champion like Xerath or Velkoz in the
          botlane, he might have a rough time.
        </p>
        <h3>Good pick with these teammates</h3>
        <p>
          Most adc's pair really well with thresh considering most adc's doesnt
          have an escape, which thresh can provide for them.
        </p>
        <h3>Counterpicks</h3>
        <p>
          Morgana: Because of her GODDAMN black shield THAT BLOCKS ALL CC WHICH
          IS BASICLY ALL THRESH IS
          <br />
          Sivir: Spellshields.. <br />
