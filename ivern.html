          <p>
            Ivern is a different but impactful jungler that pretty much works
            like a secondary support. He can provide shields buffs for his
            teammates but requires alot of practice to be played effectivly in
            the jungle. His unique playstyle makes him frustrating to play
            against and can have a huge impact throughout the whole game.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
          Iverns gameplay mostly consists of him providing shields and buffs for
          his allies while also being an excellent counterjungler considering
          his passive: "Friend of the forest" that lets him "free" the jungle
          camps instead of killing them. In late game, hes basicly a secondary
          support that build support items and make sure his teammates stay
          alive
        </p>
        <h3>Strenghts</h3>
        <p>
          As I stated in the gameplay, his early/mid game mostly consists of him
          counterjungleing. This is more effective with Ivern than other
          junglers just because of the fact that he can oneshot the junglers
          because of his passive. His strenghts also consists of him giving huge
          low cooldown shields to his teammates while providing a decent amount
          of crowd control.
        </p>
        <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          Ivern has alot of weaknesses. For example he can easiely get counter
          jungled considering how weak he can be in a 1v1 against most of the
          other junglers that are pretty strong in 1v1 situations. What makes
          Ivern a great counterjungle target is also that he cant kill the mobs,
          which means that as long as there's someone hititng him or the camp,
          he wont be able to steal back the camp unless he gets help from his
          teammates.
        </p>
        <h3>Good pick with these teammates</h3>
        <p>
          Yasuo: Because Ivern has a knockup + he is building items like Ardent
          Censer which fits perfectly with Yasuo
          <br />Rengar: If playing with a Rengar top, Ivern can provide bushes
          for him which gives him the option to jump on the enemies from
          anywhere on the map which can be very effective if the rengar knows
          what hes doing <br />
          Ivern is also great with most of the adc's (because of the fact that
          hes a support)
        </p>
        <h3>Counterpicks</h3>
        <p>
          Ivern gets countered by most early impactful junglers such as Udyr,
          Jarvan IV, Kayn, Lee sin etc. But this can be counter countered if
          your team is aware of whats happening on the map
